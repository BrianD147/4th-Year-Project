\chapter{Introduction}
Machine learning (ML) is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
\section{Neural Networks}
Neural network, a computer program that operates in a manner inspired by the natural neural network in the brain. The objective of such artificial neural networks is to perform such cognitive functions as problem solving and machine learning.
\section{Unity}
Unity is a cross-platform real-time engine developed by Unity Technologies. The engine can be used to create both three-dimensional and two-dimensional games as well as simulations for its many platforms.
\section{Python}
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 



The introduction should be about three to five pages long.
