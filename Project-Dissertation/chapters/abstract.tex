\large\textbf{Abstract}
\newline
Artificial Intelligence has been the go-to buzzword in technology circles for decades, with proponents claiming it to be the panacea for our modern age. As such, why not apply the concept of machine learning to a more mundane application?

The objective of this project was to to see if we could train agents through machine learning in a Unity environment, while passing data to and from the application externally using Jupyter Notebooks, and to achieve a particular task, i.e play football.

The ultimate goal of our Final Year project is to create a three dimensional environment akin to a football pitch, in which two teams of agents compete to score goals for their respective teams. The simulation ends when a team scores a predetermined number of goals. These agents should be controlled by a Neural Network, with the capability to recognise their own team members, members of the opposition team, their target (the football) and their objective (the opposition goal).
