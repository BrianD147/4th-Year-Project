The objective of this project was to to see if we could train agents through machine learning in a Unity environment

Artificial Intelligence has been present in our lives for a while now and is only growing more by the day.

The idea behind our Software Development final year project is to delve into the pit of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and see just how far it’s come since the 1950’s. Our project is centred on the question of can we train an agent to teach it to play football in a three-dimensional environment.
