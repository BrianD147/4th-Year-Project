\large\textbf{Abstract}
\newline
Artificial Intelligence has been the go-to buzzword in technology circles for decades, with proponents claiming it to be the cure-all for our modern age. As such, why not apply the concept of machine learning to a more mundane application?

The objective of this project was to to see if we could train agents through machine learning in a Unity environment to achieve a particular task, i.e play football.

The idea behind our Software Development final year project is to delve into the pit of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and see just how far it’s come since the 1950’s. Our project is centred on the question of can we train an agent to play football in a three-dimensional environment.
