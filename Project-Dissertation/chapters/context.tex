The initial idea of artificial intelligence was first brought around during the second world war where Alan Turing and his team developed the Bombe machine, a device capable of deciphering messages from the enigma machine. Turing stated that a machine that could converse with a human, without the human knowing that they were conversing with a machine could be said to be “Intelligent”.  With this, the foundations for artificial intelligence was created. 

John McCarthy is said to be the “father” of Artificial Intelligence, coining the term in the year 1955. He invented his own programming language, LISP which became the programming language of choice for AI development. 

Despite AI development being around for so long, research fell subject to what was known as “AI Winters”. During these phases funding for development of AI was reduced due to lack of processing power and interest fell short. With the turn of the century, research started to pick up again due to the advancements in hardware and the processing power of machines.
