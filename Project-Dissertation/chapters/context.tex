\section{Objectives}
The objectives of this project are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Design a working 3D environment in Unity to best suit our needs.}
    \item{Find a way to connect Unity and python together, allowing for data to be transferred between both the environment and the external code.}
    \item{Pass movements into the Unity environment using the external code.}
    \item{Pull observations from the Unity environment back into the external code.}
    \item{Control the agents using the external neural network.}
\end{itemize}

\section{GitHub Repository}
The GitHub repository for this project can be found at:

    https://github.com/BrianD147/4th-Year-Project. 

The sections below describe the different components in the repository and a link to each part

\subsection{README}
This contains a brief introduction and description of each component of the system. It also contains an instalation guide as to how to install and run the project.

\subsection{4th-Year-Project}
This contains the main Unity environment code used to design the 3d stadium environment and the agents. Also contains the builds nessesary to work with the notebooks within this project.

\subsection{Project Dissertation}
This contains a latex project used to write and develop out project dissertation and a PDF of the complete dissertation.


\subsection{ML-Agents}
This contains the mlagents python package, which is part of the ML-Agents Toolkit. This is a Python API that allows direct interaction with the Unity game engine as well as a collection of trainers and algorithms to train agents in the Unity environment.


\subsection{Notebooks}
This contains Jupyter notebooks used to run the python scripts and connect them to the Unity environment, with help from the ml-agents Python API. This folder contains 4 notebooks that each run different simulation types, and another notebook with an example of a Keras Neural Network. 


\subsection{Group Project 2018}
This contains an initial document stating our initial goal and a road map we wished to adhere by as development progressed.

\subsection{IronPython VS ML-Agents}
This contains a document comparing the IronPython plugin with ML-Agents and discussing the advantages ML-Agents has over IronPython, concluding in our reasons for choosing ML-Agents going forward.

\subsection{Input Data}
This contains a file stating the input data and attributes intended to be passed into the neural network, and the set of outputs the network would output. Along with template data arrays for inputs and outputs.


\subsection{Setup for Player Controller}
This contains a brief explanation of how user controlled movement can be incorporated into the ML-Agents Academy and Brain prefabs.
