\section{Acknowledgements}

The authors would like to thank our supervisors Gerard Harrison and Daniel Cregg for the time and effort they put into helping us with our project, as well as all of the tips and troubleshooting assistance they supplied.

We would also like to thank the lecturers and faculty of the GMIT Dublin Road campus, in particular Dr. John Healy, whom we found to be a constant source of useful information on programming practices, life in industry and linking the nuances of technology and modern life to ancient Greek parables.
