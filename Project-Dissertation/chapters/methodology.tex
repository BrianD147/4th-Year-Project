\chapter{Methodology}
About one to two pages.
Describe the way you went about your project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Agile / incremental and iterative approach to development. Planning, meetings.
\item What about validation and testing? Junit or some other framework.
\item If team based, did you use GitHub during the development process.
\item Selection criteria for algorithms, languages, platforms and technologies.
\end{itemize}

In this section we will review our approach to the project development, describe the methodology used and how it was implemented and how the development of the project progressed overall. At the conclusion of this methodology the reader should be left with a good sense of the project scale, as well as the steps taken throughout.

For this project we wanted to use an iterative design process, so changes and issues could easily be kept track of and dealt with in an easy and efficient manner. As such we felt the Agile method to be the best fit for us, as one of the team members has had previous experience in industry during a summer internship. His first hand experience helped guide us throughout the project, and gave the rest of us a feel on how it may be like to work in industry in the future.

(Definitions? Scrum master, stand up, etc)

The Agile method is a particular approach to project management, which is ubiquitous in the environment of Software Development. This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software, such as bugs in code, changing requirements from the client, etc. Agile uses incremental/iterative work sequences commonly known as Sprints, which is a period of time allocated for a particular phase of a project. Time is a precious resource when developing software, and as such a Sprint is considered complete once the time period expires. While some objectives set out for the Sprint may not have been realised, these additions will need to be put on the back burner in order to keep up with the Agile development cycle.

While we liked the approach the Agile method allowed us to use, we did not adhere to it in the strictest of senses. For instance, we did not appoint someone to the role of Scrum Master, preferring a more group oriented approach to problem solving and troubleshooting. A Scrum Master would be more suited to an industry environment, where they could be used as a point of contact or cohesion between large teams with differing responsibilities.

Another aspect of the Agile Methodology we utilized were "Stand ups". This is the term used for a daily progress meeting, tradaitionally held within a development area. These meetings are a quick way to gauge progress on individual aspects of a project, and are a great way to keep everyone informed and motivated. (once or twice a week for stand ups, library room, discuss work individually. Well informed anyways)

Some general principles of Agile include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Satisfy the client and continually develop software}
    \item{Changes in requirements are embraced}
    \item{Frequent delivery of working software} 
    \item{Close working relationship between client and developer(s)}
    \item{Face to face communication is integral to cohesive development, and working relations as a whole}
\end{itemize}

\section{Sprint 1: Idea}
	(Spent time brainstorming ideas, technologies, platforms, hardware, etc)
	
	Our first sprint was used to spitball potential ideas for a project, including what problem could we tackle, relevant technologies we could apply to said problem and in what manner we could approach it. 
	
\section{Sprint 2: Research}
	Spent researching our topic, looking into -relevant- technologies and languages 
	
	The next Sprint focused on researching our materials for the project, such as a suitable environment we could use, what languages we could utilize and if there were any external libraries or resources we could use to improve the overall scope.

\section{Sprint 3: Development 1}
	Set up environment, Github, etc
	
	Once we had established a framework we were happy with work finally began on the foundations of the project. To tackle to problem of version control we utilized GitHub, which we have had extensive experience using in the past. Group members were then added as collaborators, so we could work on the project in unison.  Once the blank Unity environment was created it was pushed to the Github, as well as (Ryan - notebooks, Bri - Unity, James, - MLagents)

\section{Sprint 4: Development 2}
	Integration testing of ML-Agents, Unity, Notebooks, etc
	
	The next sprint focused on the integrating and testing of the various technologies and platforms we had chosen.

\section{Sprint 5: Development 3}

\section{Sprint 6: Development 4}
	Final testing, padding out functionality

\section{Sprint 7: Cleanup \& Dissertation} 
	Writing up dissertation
